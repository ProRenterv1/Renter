# Disputes: What renters and owners should expect

Plain-language overview for customers in Canada. Operator rules live in the [staff policy](./disputes_policy_operator.md).

## Filing a dispute
- Eligible bookings: paid or recently completed. Safety/fraud issues may be accepted even after the normal window; other categories can be rejected if filed late.
- How to file: open the booking, choose **Report an issue**, describe what happened, and upload photos or video (up to the displayed size limit). If the item “broke during use,” say how it was being used.
- What to attach: before/after photos, short video of the damage or malfunction, receipts/quotes for repairs, and any helpful chat screenshots. Upload original files (no screenshots of screenshots).

## What the timelines mean
- Intake check: we quickly confirm minimum evidence. If something is missing you’ll see a request and a deadline; if you miss it the case can auto-close.
- Rebuttal window: once intake passes, the other party gets about 24 hours to respond with their side and evidence. The damage deposit (if any) stays on hold during this time.
- Review: after rebuttal or if the window expires, an operator reviews the file, may message you for clarity, and then decides. You’ll get an email/SMS with the outcome.

## Decisions
- Owner upheld: part or all of the damage deposit can be captured and used for repairs; any remainder is released to the renter.
- Renter upheld: the deposit hold (if any) is released; we may also refund other charges if warranted.
- Split outcome: we split the deposit between parties based on documented costs.
- Auto-closed: if filed too late, missing required evidence, or no rebuttal was provided in time.

## Appeals (if offered)
If you see an **Appeal** option in the app or were invited to appeal in the decision email, submit within the stated window with new facts or evidence. If you do not see an appeal option, reply to the decision email within 7 days and support will confirm whether an appeal path is available for your case.
