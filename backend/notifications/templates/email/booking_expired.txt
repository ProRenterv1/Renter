Hi {{ recipient_name|default:"there" }},

{% if recipient_role == "owner" %}
A booking for {{ listing_title }} ({{ date_range_display }}) expired before the renter completed payment, so the reservation has been canceled automatically.
{% else %}
Your booking for {{ listing_title }} ({{ date_range_display }}) expired before payment could be collected, so the request has been canceled.
{% endif %}

Those dates are now available again. If you still want to rent this item, simply submit a new request.

{% if cta_url %}View your rentals: {{ cta_url }}{% endif %}

Thanks,
{{ site_name }} Team
